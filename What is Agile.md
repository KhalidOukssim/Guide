## What is Agile?

a methodology that delivers software or incrementally from start *instead of all once* to the end.(chuia b chuia not deqa wehda)

it works by devising project to *user stories*; so at the end of each week for example, the iteration will be finished.

## How is it different?

Analysis,design,coding,and testing are continuous activities.

## Why Agile!!

1. in case of modification,you will change a microservice (iteration ) instead of all the project or delete it without having bugs in the project.
2. testing each iteration is very helpful to know the placement's errors.
3. always satisfied even the all the project is not finished yet
4. building only what is essential
5. less costs and less waste of time (khessran lfloss la)
